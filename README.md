# NBM-Verif
Verification tools for the National Blend of Models

This repo is designed to hold python notebooks to be used for case study/tactical verification of the National Blend of Models.
Each notebook runs stand alone and is designed to be run in Google Colab, which is accessible to anyone in NOAA in a web browser.
However the notebooks are designed in such a way to be easily adaptable to run on any computer running python.

Input files come from the Amazon "Big Data" NOAA server, and obs are genrally provided by Synoptic Labs.
